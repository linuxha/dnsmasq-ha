dnsmasq-ha
==========

dnsmasq failover (keepalived)

### Overview
This project help you to deploy dnsmasq With HA and automatic recovery. A basic cluster is a dnsmasq master and a dnsmasq backup. This is only for Ubuntu Server.

Requires keepalived (checking on that). I don't think redis-ha is required.

### How to use?
* Clone this repo on all of the node:
```
git clone https://github.com/linuxha/dnsmasq-ha.git
```

* Edit the configuration file. The configuration files stored in the following location:
  * redis-ha/conf/keepalived.conf.master
    - This is the keepalived master configuration, you have to edit the VIP.
  * redis-ha/conf/keepalived.conf.backup
    - This is the keepalived backup configuration, you have to edit the VIP.

* To deploy the master node:
```
sudo python dnsmasq-ha.py master
```

* To deploy the backup node:
```
sudo python dnsmasq-ha.py backup
```
